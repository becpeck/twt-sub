### A website to tweet substack posts without demotion.

- Tweak the URL of your post, or have the front page do it for you.
- All tweaked urls will redirect to the original substack post url, without using the second-level domain, hopefully avoiding demotion when linked on twitter.
- Also hoping to display working cards on all links.
